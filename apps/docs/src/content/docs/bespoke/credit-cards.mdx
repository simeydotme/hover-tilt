Let's create some credit cards!

We will use a `<img />` with the credit card image as the background (slot-content), and let's also do a version where the glare is masked by a fancy pattern to give it some zesty flair!

<Aside title="Web Components &amp; Tailwind">
  I will demonstrate these all **as Web Components with TailwindCSS**, but using the information throughout the docs it
  should be **fairly simple to re-purpose this code with Svelte and Vanilla CSS**.
</Aside>

## Basic Credit Card

Here we put an image of a Credit Card inside the `<hover-tilt>` element, and use the component-props to make it pop!

We want a really pronounced glare effect to make it look metallic, so we set the `glare-intensity` to `3`. Also we make it pop out of the frame with an exaggerated `scale-factor` of `1.15`. Border radius is set to `4%/6%` to match a credit card's rounded corners in a responsive manner.

<CodeWithPreview lang="svelte" title="index.html" code={basicCreditCard}>
  <BasicCreditCard />

  <small class="block mt-4 text-center text-balance text-gray-500"><em>Notice how the black parts of the card don't really glare as much as the metallic parts? That's due to the `blend-mode` being set to `overlay` by default. You can change this with the `blend-mode` prop.</em></small>
</CodeWithPreview>

## Credit Card with Glare Mask

Here we add a `glare-mask` to the `<hover-tilt>` element, tweak the `glare-intensity` and set the `blend-mode` to `difference` to get a more interesting effect.

The `glare-mask` is a transparent PNG with the American Express "world service" logo repeating pattern.

<CodeWithPreview
  lang="svelte"
  title="index.html"
  code={creditCardWithGlareMask}
  ins={['0.5', 7, 8, '/assets/amex.webp']}
>
  <CreditCardWithGlareMask />
</CodeWithPreview>

### Adding a clip-mask to the glare

The edges of the card look a bit strange with the pattern glare applied. Let's clip the glare mask to the edges of the card to give it a nice matte border effect.

Using a bit of CSS we can also target the `.tilt::before` pseudo-element to clip the glare mask to the edges of the card. This will give us the desired matte border effect.

**_TailwindCSS doesn't support CSS `clip-path` yet, so we have to use plain CSS in this scenario._**

<CodeWithPreview lang="svelte" title="index.html" code={creditCardWithClipMask} ins={['clipped', 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]}>
  <CreditCardWithClipMask />
</CodeWithPreview>

### Masking out the secuity chip

Going even further, we can use a more advanced `polygon()` syntax to clip out the chip from the glare mask, too!

_This could also be done by editing the `glare-mask` image so it already has a blank area for the chip._

<CodeWithPreview
  lang="svelte"
  title="index.html"
  code={creditCardWithClipMaskChip}
  ins="-with-chip"
  mark={[/polygon\(.*?\)/g]}
>
  <CreditCardWithClipMaskChip />
</CodeWithPreview>

## Going holographic!

Let's go a bit crazy and add some custom CSS to really make things extra!

<Aside type="tip" title="Unecessary?">
  This is **not really how I expect 99% of users to use** this `<HoverTilt />` component. However I want to show that
  the **base component can be modified heavily** with some **clever CSS** to achieve very special results!
</Aside>

Explainer and Demo below the code block! ↓

### Adding a holo/rainbow gradient

<CodeWithPreview
  lang="svelte"
  title="index.html"
  code={creditCardWithClipMaskChipHolo}
  ins={['holo', 9, 10, { range: '23-38' }]}
>
  <CreditCardWithClipMaskChipHolo />
</CodeWithPreview>

Let's break down the extra holographic bits step-by-step!

<Steps>
1. First we add the '.holo' class to the `<hover-tilt>` element.

2. Next we modify the `glare-mask-mode` to `luminance` as we will be using 2 masks here.

3. We also set the `glare-mask-composite` to `intersect` to ensure the 2 masks are combined correctly.

4. Inside of the `::before` we re-assign `mask-image` to use both the `--hover-tilt-glare-mask` and the `--hover-tilt-default-gradient` CSS variables.

   > _This is now our 'hologram' mask layer instead of glare layer. This will allow the mask to follow our cursor, just like the glare gradient does._

5. We apply a rainbow-gradient `background-image` to the `::before` pseudo-element and set the position to the cursor with `--gradient-x` and `--gradient-y` CSS variables.

   > _This allows the rainbow to move a little bit giving a more realistic holographic effect._

6. Now we create a new pseudo-element `::after` which will hold the new glare effect.

   > _We set a common `content: ''`, `position: absolute`, etc to ensure this layer covers the `.tilt` element._

7. Finally we are applying the `var(--hover-tilt-default-gradient)` to the `background-image` and set the `mix-blend-mode` to `hard-light` to ensure the glare effect is visible.

   > _Also setting `opacity` to `calc(var(--hover-tilt-opacity, 0) - 0.75)` reduces the glare's power._

</Steps>

---

Again; this is very extra, and I expect only a few very eager users may want to go into this much detail. In reality
they may want to create their very own custom component instead of using `<HoverTilt />`. But if they have the desire they could start with `<HoverTilt />` and use the CSS variables to create their own glare/holo design!
